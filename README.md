## Description
This project aims to create a an organization chart in 3 dimensions to allow the visualization of more complex organizations. It uses a web app as its main interface.

To handle the 3D graphics, we have implemented vectors, matrices, and quaternions. All of the graphics are displayed using HTML elements and CSS styling.

## Features
The main attraction of this project is that the camera can be moved around by dragging with the mouse to view the chart from alternative angles. The camera can zoom in and out to focus on different scopes of the organization.

Employees or members can be added and removed from the organization live and the chart will update accordingly. When selecting a member of the chart, it will display relevant information and show their connections to other members in the organization.
